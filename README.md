## Radial Visualization Shiny Gadgets


The following package creates a RShiny Gadgets for Radial Visualizations.


## Star Coordinates 

The original Star Coordinates as proposed by Kandogan [1] along with optional axis calibration [3]. As the original approach is based on solely numerical attributes, an extension to hybrid representation can be applied [4]. 

Other extensions for the approach are implemented. Hints [4]  and Orthographic Star Coordinates [2].


## Installation


You can install the stable version from the main branch:

    devtools::install_github(repo = "jmatute/RadialShinyGadgets", ref="main")
